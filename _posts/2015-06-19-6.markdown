When an object is placed on a touch screen, the [python script](https://github.com/markwsilliman/Liatris/blob/master/TouchScreen/send_touchscreen_points_to_server.py), written with [Kivy](http://kivy.org/), POSTs all three touch points to the local network. The local network will then determine the LP and orientation of the object.

We use a multi-touch projected capacitive touch screen that [supports 20 simultaneous touch points](http://liatris.org/2015/02/01/12/). This allows us to accurately determine the pose of many objects placed on the same screen.

*Note: Other types of touch screens, like those that use [infrared touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen#Infrared_grid), won’t work because Liatris requires multi-touch support.*

[Kivy](http://kivy.org/) provides an easy way to develop applications for touch screens and is compatible with Python.

[The script](https://github.com/markwsilliman/Liatris/blob/master/TouchScreen/send_touchscreen_points_to_server.py) is brief. Every time a point is read by the touch screen, on_touch_down() is called and an object called “touch” is passed to the function.  touch.x and touch.y is the cartesian coordinate.
