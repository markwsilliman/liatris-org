The touch screen, RFID reader, and robot communicate over a local network.

*Note: For simplicity, the local network code is packaged together with the API.  Therefore, the web server used to host the API also acts as a local network. In practice, the global and local networks would be separate.*

The local network is used to:

1. POST points read by the touch screen to a local database.
2. POST an RFID tag's values that are read by the RFID reader's antenna.
3. GET the most recent object and its orientation, calculated by reviewing the last three touch screen points.
4. GET the most recent RFID tag value.
