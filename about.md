The ability to reliably read an object’s pose and identity without relying on vision will rip down the barriers that prevent robotics from being present in our everyday lives.  Fully autonomous robotics can be developed *today* if objects can tell the robot not only what they are but what their purpose is and how to utilize them.

I ask you to contribute to Liatris.  The project is [vast and requires a wide range of expertise](http://liatris.org/2015/02/01/11/) but the potential is real and the benefits can be acquired in the short term.

Change the world,
